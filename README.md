# Core_Four_Capstone_Project

## Pick your favorite dessert

## There are three stages to the project.

### First phase: A cosine similarity-based content-based recommendation system that displays 5 or 6 dessert choices depending on the dessert we selected. As a result, the model will be trained on specific characteristics such as the dessert's kind, origin, and primary components.

### Second phase: A recommendation system in which the user enters a list of accessible items in the kitchen, and our model searches through the existing recipes to select 5 or 6 dessert creations.

### Third phase: Our model will be trained to predict if a recipe is a cookie, cake, or bread in the third phase. As a result, the user will be able to enter the quantity of various elements and construct their own recipe here.
